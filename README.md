# FlyingMario-Snake-TurtleShells
snake game 

Mario gains more turtle shells as he catches Bowser. It could be difficult to catch Bowser sometimes since Mario doesn't get him at the middle of Bowser. Mario could lose by touching his own turtle shells. 

This is one of my first codeing projects;therefore, I might have some minor errors. 

Download the zip file from the "clone or download" button.

Open the file folder named "FlyingMario-Snake-TurtleShells" 

Open the "MainSnake.java" with your IDE and compile the code. 

Leave everything in the same file or you might have some issues. 

Now you could play the game!!
